# Week 1 

Comment on the personality type identified in the questionnaire.  Discuss the role you hope to play in the team.

As a <b>Specialist</b>, I tend to contribute by analysing information carefully, spotting issues others may overlook, and provifing accurate, well thought out solutions. This role suits me as I prefer quality and correctness over speed. 

In a team, I hope to act as a reliable soure of knowledge and insight. I want to support decision making by providing clear explanations, evidence, and techinical input where needed. I may not always be the loudest voice, but I aim to add value through thoughtful contributions and problem solving.
